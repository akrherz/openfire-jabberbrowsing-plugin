# Openfire Jabber Browsing Information Plugin

This is a plugin for the Openfire Real-time Communications server. It provides an implementation for service discovery 
using the `jabber:iq:browse` namespace, as specified in [XEP-0011: Jabber Browsing](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0011.html).

Note Well: The protocol implemented by this plugin has been superseded in favor of Service Discovery mechanisms as 
specified in [XEP-0030: Service Discovery](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html). This plugin should not be
installed in Openfire, unless there is a pressing need for backwards compatibility in regard to XEP-0011.
